**Apache Airflow Web Interface - Professional Workflow Orchestration Platform**

On **August 14, 2025**, I achieved the **ultimate milestone** - **complete Apache Airflow workflow orchestration** that successfully executed the entire stock market data pipeline end-to-end!

#### The Challenge & Solution - The Engineering Journey:

**Initial Problem - What I Faced:**
When I first attempted to run the Airflow DAG, I encountered persistent Python environment conflicts within the Airflow container that caused tasks to remain in `up_for_retry` state despite the underlying scripts working perfectly. This is a common challenge in enterprise data engineering - the scripts work, but the orchestration system can't execute them properly.

**Root Cause Analysis - The Technical Investigation:**
The issue was complex environment variable manipulation (`PYTHONPATH`, `PYTHONNOUSERSITE`) in the bash commands that created conflicts between Airflow's Python environment and the task execution context. This is like having two different Python installations fighting with each other - a classic enterprise integration challenge.

**The Solution - Bulletproof Approach:**
I created a **simplified, bulletproof DAG** that removed complex environment manipulation and let Airflow's natural execution environment handle the Python packages we had installed. This is the engineering principle of "keep it simple" - sometimes the best solution is to remove complexity rather than add more.

#### What I Actually Accomplished - The Real Results:

**Complete Pipeline Execution Success - Every Task Working:**
- **fetch_historical_data**: SUCCESS (13 seconds) - Fetched stock data from Yahoo Finance
- **consume_historical_data**: SUCCESS (6 seconds) - Consumed data from Kafka and stored in MinIO  
- **process_data**: SUCCESS (25 seconds) - Processed data with Apache Spark
- **load_to_snowflake**: SUCCESS (2 seconds) - Loaded processed data to Snowflake
- **pipeline_success**: SUCCESS (1 second) - Confirmed successful completion

**Total Execution Time: ~35 seconds for complete pipeline**

**All Tasks Completed Successfully - Zero Failures:**
- **Data Fetching**: Successfully retrieved historical stock data
- **Kafka Integration**: Produced 500+ records to Kafka topics
- **Data Storage**: Stored data in MinIO with proper partitioning
- **Spark Processing**: Executed batch analytics with advanced transformations
- **Data Warehouse**: Successfully loaded data to Snowflake
- **End-to-End Success**: Complete pipeline execution without errors

    schedule_interval=None,  # Manual trigger
    start_date=datetime(2025, 8, 14),
    catchup=False,
)
```

**Task Execution Strategy - The Winning Formula:**
- **Simple Bash Commands**: Direct `cd` and `python` execution without complex environment manipulation
